## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Plain CSS
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned many fundamental concepts about Javascript and practiced those concepts on this project. These include arrays, objects, boolean, if else statements, operators, for loops, the Math Objects as well as return statements. Despite the new concepts I learned, I used concepts from my previous knowledge of Javascript including the DOM and functions. This project was quite challenging at the beginning however I recapped some concepts which helped me understand the issues I was missing, in my code.

Javascript Snippet Code: 

```js

function randomCharacters() {
    let randomChar = Math.floor(Math.random() * characters.length)
    return characters[randomChar]
}

```
